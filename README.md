# 👋 Hej, I’m @claushauge
I used to be a Graphic Designer, but nowadays I'm more focused on front end development. I got a portfolio @ [haugestudio.dk](https://haugestudio.dk), although I'm currently working on a makeover of it. In the daytime, I'm finishing my degree in web development at the Media College Denmark, while at night I help out my friends with great graphic design. I'm the type of person who needs an office and steady working hours to really be productive (so much for stereotypes about developers), and I love to create great websites, that both look great and consists of some great code. Also I'm:
- a sucker for design, architecture and art 👀
- quite decent at keeping plants alive 🌱
- great at cooking 👨‍🍳
- currently fetching stuff in React.JS 🖥
