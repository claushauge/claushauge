# ðŸ‘‹ Hej, Iâ€™m @claushauge
I'm a graphic designer and soon-to-be front end developer. Currently I'm studying at Media College Denmark, while I help out my friends with great graphic design in my spare time 
- ðŸ‘€ I like design, architecture and going to art galleries. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use GitHub in my workflow.
- Like to know more? Well, I guess you have to wait for a while, I'm giving my portfolio a makeover at the moment...
